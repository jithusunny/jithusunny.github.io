Pssshh: [Adobe firefly](https://firefly.adobe.com/inspire/images) generated it ðŸ˜‰
I love these kind of tools - amazing!

I actually wanted some meaningful logo like the YinYang, etc. 

But this one is good as a version 1 logo - looks pretty pretty in my opinion.
Do you like it? ðŸ‘†


Also got a favicon created from it thanks to https://realfavicongenerator.net/favicon_result?file_id=p1i096r2vmk51kje15ga2ndkl76

Tomorrow if I get time, I will move these posts to new blog at zuperb.in

That's it for today, wishing you a great day!
