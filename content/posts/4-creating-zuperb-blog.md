Summary: Moving the posts from blogspot to hugo site hosted in Github pages at zuperb.in


## What next?
So, we have a name for this, a domain for the website.   
Next, we'll move these posts from blogspot to that web address.


## Plan
For that, we need to:
1. put these posts in a place
2. connect the domain zuperb.in with that place of hosting

## The site generator - Hugo
The posts need to also look like a blog.

I'd tried Hugo some time back, it was great.
Hugo generates static websites like blog, etc. from markdown files.

Followed this https://gohugo.io/getting-started/quick-start/ to get a basic blog out of the previous posts I put in blogspot and this 4th new one locally.

## Hosting - Github Pages

Some options are:
1. turn my own computer into a server
2. renting place at AWS
3. Github page

We'll need 1 or 2 soon. But for now 3 is fine.

Followed this
https://docs.github.com/en/pages/getting-started-with-github-pages/creating-a-github-pages-site to create a blank site with GH pages at https://jithusunny.github.io/

Next is deploying the hugo site in Github Pages.

Thanks to this Hugo guide: https://gohugo.io/hosting-and-deployment/hosting-on-github/, iz done.



## Custom domain for Github page

Next let's see how to make the github pages come up when somebody goes to my domain - zuperb.in

Phew, followed this: https://docs.github.com/en/pages/configuring-a-custom-domain-for-your-github-pages-site/managing-a-custom-domain-for-your-github-pages-site

Went to my domain registrar, did some DNS record updates, some Github settings fiddling, and a lot of trial and error. 

## Finally
Finally, we have our new blog at https://www.zuperb.in/ !

I have some directions from this point in my mind.
The journey will get interesting, and challenging. Letsi.

Thanks for visiting, have a fruitful day! :)
