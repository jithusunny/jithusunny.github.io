Summary: Checking out some ideas on how to code well

## Indecision
In the last one, I had resolved to build the backend for Zuperb in two frameworks - Flask and NestJS. After that, I was thinking Express is better than NestJS. I think I'm swinging between 'batteries-included' so that I can quickly build things vs. 'bare-bones' so that I can have more control and not carry things I don't need.

Another option is to build a version and little by little move towards the ideal. I can't quite put into words what I feel. Something like, step-by-step isn't going to let me move to the ideal. The beginning has to be a little thought out.

## Watching videos for guidance

While browsing ideas/things described above, I stumbled upon a video by Douglas Crockford - [The Next Programming Language - Douglas Crockford](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R2idkNdKqpQ)

He is talking about doing things in something called 'Actor model'. Looks interesting. This made me want to checkout Elixir a little bit. Side-note, I love listening to Douglas Crockford. What a lucid presentation! 

Hmm, so it is Elixir vs. Flask vs. Express now!

Then I also watched 2/3 of this video - [Why Isn't Functional Programming the Norm?] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QyJZzq0v7Z4). I liked FP from the little haskell, Lisp I tried.

Hmm, it's late.

I'll continue tomorrow. Good day! :)
