Summary: "Post on a new beginning in my life. Building something in public that is aimed at making life better."


## Intro (hype)

This marks the beginning of a new phase in my life.

I'm going to build something in public. This is something that is coming out through me I feel, more than I creating it. This is an idea whose time has come, it looks like.

Let me search and get that proverb that says the same...

    "Nothing is more powerful than an idea whose time has come." - Victor Hugo

I love quotations, which are words pointing to some idea. I love ideas - ideas that inspire. The thing that I'm building will have a designated area for quotes.

Alright, that is enough hype about what is it about.

## What is it about?

It is about life.
All of the following are true about "this thing":
 
It is a:

- system
- website
- app
- platform
- way of life.

This is a way of life, imagined and created by life, for life. 
 
What's the purpose of this system/website/way? What is it about?
Of life, by life, and For Life.
 
## More about it
It will simplify, enhance, ..[add more words of this kind] life. More on this in the upcoming episodes. You can think of this as the first post of a 'building in public' project.

I'm not making fun of you. Agree, this may sound a bit dramatic, wishy-washy, etc., at-least to some of you. This is just the beginning, my wife is calling me to have lunch. I'll wrap up the beginning with this.


### Catch you later
I'd love to see all kind of reactions and responses to this. 
 
It may be about a certain grammatical mistake I made. It may be your positive/negative thoughts on this, encouragement, discouragement, etc. Whatever it is, feel free to comment. 
 
 
Thanks for visiting! ðŸ˜‡
