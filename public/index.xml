      <description>Summary Streamed thoughts about how to proceed with the project onto paper - 5 sheets. Transcribed them (converted to text) with the help of ChatGPT. Edited a little bit, fixed a few errors, added headings, etc. Too long; maybe don&amp;rsquo;t read!

      <description>Pssshh: Adobe firefly generated it ðŸ˜‰ I love these kind of tools - amazing!&#xA;I actually wanted some meaningful logo like the YinYang, etc.&#xA;But this one is good as a version 1 logo - looks pretty pretty in my opinion. Do you like it? ðŸ‘†&#xA;Also got a favicon created from it thanks to https://realfavicongenerator.net/favicon_result?file_id=p1i096r2vmk51kje15ga2ndkl76&#xA;Tomorrow if I get time, I will move these posts to new blog at zuperb.</description>
