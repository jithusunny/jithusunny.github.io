<h2 id="indecision">Indecision</h2>
<p>In the last one, I had resolved to build the backend for Zuperb in two frameworks - Flask and NestJS. After that, I was thinking Express is better than NestJS. I think I&rsquo;m swinging between &lsquo;batteries-included&rsquo; so that I can quickly build things vs. &lsquo;bare-bones&rsquo; so that I can have more control and not carry things I don&rsquo;t need.</p>
<p>Another option is to build a version and little by little move towards the ideal. I can&rsquo;t quite put into words what I feel. Something like, step-by-step isn&rsquo;t going to let me move to the ideal. The beginning has to be a little thought out.</p>
<h2 id="watching-videos-for-guidance">Watching videos for guidance</h2>
<p>While browsing ideas/things described above, I stumbled upon a video by Douglas Crockford - <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R2idkNdKqpQ">The Next Programming Language - Douglas Crockford</a></p>
<p>He is talking about doing things in something called &lsquo;Actor model&rsquo;. Looks interesting. This made me want to checkout Elixir a little bit. Side-note, I love listening to Douglas Crockford. What a lucid presentation!</p>
<p>Hmm, so it is Elixir vs. Flask vs. Express now!</p>
<p>Then I also watched 2/3 of this video - <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QyJZzq0v7Z4">Why Isn&rsquo;t Functional Programming the Norm?</a>. I liked FP from the little haskell, Lisp I tried.</p>
<p>Hmm, it&rsquo;s late.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll continue tomorrow. Good day! :)</p>
