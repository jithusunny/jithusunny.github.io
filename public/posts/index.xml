      <description>Summary Learning Clojure Syntax&#xA;Going the functional route I&amp;rsquo;ve been watching Rich Hickey talking about Clojure ideas, Datomic, etc. after the last post. He is a charismatic speaker, no question about it. But more than his charisma and persuasion, the ideas themselves are impressive. Simple in the real sense, I felt. There is a certain elegance, clarity and sanity in the functional world I feel. Less magic. Okay. Let&amp;rsquo;s go.</description>

      <description>Summary Not spending enough time these days due to other things I&amp;rsquo;m involved in. Going for Functional programming/Clojure for Zuperb.&#xA;What&amp;rsquo;s happening? It&amp;rsquo;s been a couple of days since I last sat down for Zuperb. Pop and Mom are in town. They staying with my sister, but I&amp;rsquo;m visiting them in the evenings after work. There&amp;rsquo;s also a workation coming up - to Munnar on Friday. So I&amp;rsquo;ll be away from Zuperb for a couple more days.</description>

      <description>Summary: Checking out some ideas on how to code well&#xA;Indecision In the last one, I had resolved to build the backend for Zuperb in two frameworks - Flask and NestJS. After that, I was thinking Express is better than NestJS. I think I&amp;rsquo;m swinging between &amp;lsquo;batteries-included&amp;rsquo; so that I can quickly build things vs. &amp;lsquo;bare-bones&amp;rsquo; so that I can have more control and not carry things I don&amp;rsquo;t need.</description>

      <description>Summary Streamed thoughts about how to proceed with the project onto paper - 5 sheets. Transcribed them (converted to text) with the help of ChatGPT. Edited a little bit, fixed a few errors, added headings, etc. Too long; maybe don&amp;rsquo;t read! Okay, my mind says: I will start off writing what I thought last: &amp;ldquo;keep moving.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Because my father and mother are both teachers&amp;hellip; Wait a minute, not because they are teachers, maybe because of their teaching style&amp;hellip; Hmm, now when I think about it, it&amp;rsquo;s not just in teaching, it&amp;rsquo;s a general psychological thing - &amp;ldquo;Pointing out mistakes, imperfections, flaws, etc.</description>

      <description>Pssshh: Adobe firefly generated it ðŸ˜‰ I love these kind of tools - amazing!&#xA;I actually wanted some meaningful logo like the YinYang, etc.&#xA;But this one is good as a version 1 logo - looks pretty pretty in my opinion. Do you like it? ðŸ‘†&#xA;Also got a favicon created from it thanks to https://realfavicongenerator.net/favicon_result?file_id=p1i096r2vmk51kje15ga2ndkl76&#xA;Tomorrow if I get time, I will move these posts to new blog at zuperb.</description>

      <description>Summary: Finding a name, getting website for this project.&#xA;Intro This endeavor/project/website needs a name.&#xA;People say naming is difficult. Very true, I felt, for this project. Read Part 1 to get an idea why.&#xA;Life has infinitely many facets. A project that&amp;rsquo;s about life should also have a name like &amp;rsquo;life&#39;.&#xA;Fun exercise: try creating a word like &amp;rsquo;life&#39;.&#xA;The immediate reason why a name is required I want to put these posts/logs in some place, a website.</description>

      <description>Summary: &amp;ldquo;Post on a new beginning in my life. Building something in public that is aimed at making life better.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;Intro (hype) This marks the beginning of a new phase in my life.&#xA;I&amp;rsquo;m going to build something in public. This is something that is coming out through me I feel, more than I creating it. This is an idea whose time has come, it looks like.&#xA;Let me search and get that proverb that says the same&amp;hellip;</description>
