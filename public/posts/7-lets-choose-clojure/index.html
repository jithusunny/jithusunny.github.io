<p>Not spending enough time these days due to other things I&rsquo;m involved in. Going for Functional programming/Clojure for Zuperb.</p>
<h1 id="whats-happening">What&rsquo;s happening?</h1>
<p>It&rsquo;s been a couple of days since I last sat down for Zuperb. Pop and Mom are in town. They staying with my sister, but I&rsquo;m visiting them in the evenings after work.
There&rsquo;s also a workation coming up - to Munnar on Friday. So I&rsquo;ll be away from Zuperb for a couple more days. In the future, I want Zuperb to be available if I need in these kind of days as well. Something like God? Invisible, but everywhere ðŸ˜›</p>
<h1 id="whats-happening-with-zuperb">What&rsquo;s happening with Zuperb?</h1>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been going through various programming languages. In the last post, I said I want to try Flask vs. Express vs. Elixir. I continued to read about stuff from that point, and looks like I&rsquo;ve found one that I may finally start building Zuperb in!</p>
<p>Listened to some videos on programming paradigms, evolution of languages, functional programming, etc. A few things/opinions I learned about:</p>
<ul>
<li>The original idea Small talk creator meant by &lsquo;Object oriented programming&rsquo; is something like the Actor model: there are actors/processes/objects that can do stuff, and they talk to each other through messages.</li>
<li>And things like OO people themselves suggest to use composition instead of inheritance, etc.</li>
<li>Programming in functional style can reduce the chances of code rot, give peace of mind. This talk - <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0if71HOyVjY&amp;t=1730s">Functional Programming in 40 Minutes â€¢ Russ Olsen</a> - is a recommended watch. I loved the picture he is painting with words about the functional world. I&rsquo;m sold on it.</li>
</ul>
<p>You can see I was already biased towards functional style. When <a href="https://pramode.net/">Pramode</a> first introduced me to functional programming, I thought that&rsquo;s great. LISP was weird and cool. I must say, there is also some attraction due to the reputation that LISP, and functional languages have:</p>
<ul>
<li>it is like mathematical functions</li>
<li>very expressive</li>
<li>maintainable in the long-run</li>
<li>prove-able</li>
<li>can reason about code better</li>
</ul>
<p>All FP advocates seem to be saying if you want peace of mind, sanity, go for FP. That&rsquo;s the strongest temptation for me, I think.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve even felt other languages are not my taste. Maybe I&rsquo;m comparing with the experience from LISP, haskell, etc. But those were small hello world programs. Let&rsquo;s see if I&rsquo;ll still like it after writing a fair amount in it.</p>
<p>Among functional languages, some time was spent on comparing Clojure and Elixir. I&rsquo;m leaning towards Clojure. I also saw Clojure comes in the top of lists like &lsquo;most loved language&rsquo;, &lsquo;most paid&rsquo;, etc. ðŸ˜‰</p>
<h1 id="hello-clojure">Hello Clojure</h1>
<p>Clojure is a LISP, got paranthesis.
Duh, that&rsquo;s all I know.</p>
<p>Let me learn a little bit.</p>
<h1 id="hello-pedestal">Hello Pedestal</h1>
<p>The guy in the video linked above, Russ,  works at Pedestal.</p>
<p>I can use that to develop web applications in Clojure.
<a href="http://pedestal.io/pedestal/0.7/index.html">http://pedestal.io/pedestal/0.7/index.html</a></p>
<p>One other blogpost I read also had this on the top of the list of &lsquo;frameworks&rsquo; in clojure.</p>
<p>Oh, and by the way, I&rsquo;m coming across (and bookmarking mostly) more and more interesting videos like this one - <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SxdOUGdseq4">Simple made Easy</a> by Rich Hickey(author of Clojure)</p>
<h1 id="baby-steps-in-clojure">Baby steps in Clojure</h1>
<p>Pure functions don&rsquo;t change anything, have no side-effects. They just relate one set with another set, like a mathematical function. They connect some input with some output. If I give this input, I always get that output, guarantee. It doesn&rsquo;t also change something somewhere else, like the value of some variable.</p>
<p>But if my accounting software doesn&rsquo;t &lsquo;change&rsquo; the account balance when I take money from it, how can I use the software?</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;ll have to make changes, have side-effects to have a tool that works.</p>
<p>Every functional language deals with states, side effects in a different way, I had learnt from Russ.</p>
<p>Skimming through the getting started section of Clojure, I&rsquo;m starting to learn how Clojure deals with states, mutating states, etc. - Identity.</p>
<h1 id="identity">Identity</h1>
<p>Identity is &ldquo;a stable logical entity associated with a series of different values over time&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Wow, I heard a similar thing from Alan Watts. Something like - we are like a whirlpool, like a knot moving across a rope - a identifiable pattern(stable, logical entity) that&rsquo;s always changing(a series of different values over time). It&rsquo;s not a cat on the mat. It&rsquo;s a catting on the matting!</p>
<p>Even when I thought I&rsquo;ll go ahead with Clojure, I wasn&rsquo;t fully sure if the language would have ideas at its core that I can connect with. Not saying, I&rsquo;m awesome. But that I tend to like ideas that connect with the ideas around reality, nature of reality, nature of &lsquo;I&rsquo;, etc.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Identities are mental tools we use to superimpose continuity on a world which is constantly, functionally, creating new values of itself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Wow. That&rsquo;s exactly how I these days perceive reality - how I, others, and other things exist out there.</p>
<p>Great start!</p>
<p>Will stop skimming and dive into this, but on another day.</p>
<h1 id="wrapping-up">Wrapping up</h1>
<p>That&rsquo;s it for today. I&rsquo;m guessing I&rsquo;ll learn and build in Clojure little by little going forward.</p>
<p>Thanks for watching, uhm I mean, reading.</p>
<p>Great day! ðŸ˜Š</p>
