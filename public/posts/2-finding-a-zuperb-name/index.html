<h2 id="intro">Intro</h2>
<p>This endeavor/project/website needs a name.</p>
<p>People say naming is difficult. Very true, I felt, for this project. Read Part 1 to get an idea why.</p>
<p>Life has infinitely many facets. A project that&rsquo;s about life should also have a name like &rsquo;life'.</p>
<p>Fun exercise: try creating a word like &rsquo;life'.</p>
<h2 id="the-immediate-reason-why-a-name-is-required">The immediate reason why a name is required</h2>
<p>I want to put these posts/logs in some place, a website. Showing it to you is one reason. Another is: these posts where I document all this is also part of my life. The system should have a place for that too.</p>
<p>These are not just blogposts - these are records about the genesis of the system. It is like the history or story of the system.</p>
<p>Soon the system itself will know those stories. These posts will move into that system. For now we want a place to put these posts, get them when needed and share that with the you, the world. Websites are great for that.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll create a website. I want to have a name for that website.</p>
<h2 id="where-do-we-start">Where do we start?</h2>
<p>I have a few domains now:</p>
<ul>
<li>jisuka.net</li>
<li>expressing.online</li>
<li>83percent.in.</li>
</ul>
<p>Nothing much happening in them.</p>
<p>The last two are related to ideas that will manifest some time in some form in this project.</p>
<p>First one was supposed to be my own personal website. It has some dummy content now. jisuka is my nickname: first 2 letters from my name, father&rsquo;s name, family name. The system we are building will soon have a home for the person Jithu also. So all of the above 3 can soon retire, maybe.</p>
<h2 id="thoughts-about-the-name">Thoughts about the name</h2>
<p>For this project, I want a name that does not reflect the person &lsquo;Jithu&rsquo;. Because, this will be a system that persons/people would want to use. This is not (just) about me.</p>
<p>As a side-note: I invite you, the reader, to keep following this project/space. This project will have life as its top priority. This is a project of life, by life, for life. Damn, it&rsquo;s starting to sound hollow.</p>
<p>Let the actions speak.</p>
<h2 id="qualities-of-a-good-name">Qualities of a good name</h2>
<p>There are many qualities a great name should have.</p>
<ul>
<li>catchy: google, swiggy</li>
<li>reflect the meaning/personality/theme of the thing it is pointing at: zomato</li>
<li>it should be easy to remember, distinct, short, etc.: airbnb, uber, ola</li>
</ul>
<p>Due to the nature of this project, it should also be able to go well with anything related to life - food, programming, nature, quotes, recipes, projects, journaling, etc.</p>
<h2 id="history">History</h2>
<p>I spent so many hours (spanning over many past months) trying to find the best, most suitable name. And I failed.</p>
<p>Hmm, a part of me is so eager to establish that I know &lsquo;failed&rsquo; that is just one way of looking at it. Anyway, I did learn one lesson very well - imperfection is inevitable. One must learn to live with it.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s not get sucked into unnecessary details and history.</p>
<h2 id="today">Today</h2>
<p>Today I thought, let&rsquo;s settle with some name that is decent, okay. And rename later if we find a perfect name, we&rsquo;ll keep a tab open for that.</p>
<p>Some names I found today:</p>
<ul>
<li>superness.in</li>
<li>topflow.in</li>
<li>zuperb.in</li>
</ul>
<p>.com were taken/expensive.</p>
<p>.in is fine for now.</p>
<h2 id="zuperb">Zuperb!</h2>
<p>Zuperb is a superb name, you have to agree ;)</p>
<ul>
<li>sounds positive</li>
<li>appears energetic</li>
<li>feels inspiring</li>
<li>people can connect regardless of their age, language, culture</li>
<li>is short</li>
<li>etc.</li>
</ul>
<p>I&rsquo;m going ahead with that name.</p>
<p>My wife commented that the use of &lsquo;z&rsquo; is like in &lsquo;freakzz&rsquo;, etc. :P
But she liked it.</p>
<h2 id="zuperbin">zuperb.in</h2>
<p>Bought zuperb.in!</p>
<p>From Godaddy. Spent a couple of thousand rupees for a couple of years.</p>
<p>Try visiting Zuperb!</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve setup a redirection to this blog for now.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s getting late for bed, Sunday night. Signing off for now.</p>
<p>Thanks for visiting! ðŸ˜‡</p>
